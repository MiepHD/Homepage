<h1>Cuscon</h1>

<p>Started: October 2022</p>
<p>Ended: Not planned</p>

  This icon pack brings variety and dynamism to your Home screen with over 5000
  icons. Without a background, each icon looks unique and breaks the constant
  pattern of the grid. All icons have a black border which allows them to fit on
  most backgrounds. The color palette is retained and integrated into the icon.
  This makes the icons easy to recognize. Cuscon also brings a natural
  consistency to the size of the icons. All icons have the same spacing,
  resulting in a standard size without the need to mask icons. Unlike many other
  icon packs, Cuscon's philosophy supports the creation of icons for games and
  other complex icons. Therefore, it is possible to have Cuscon fully applied
  without annoying unedited icons that don't fit the theme. Since Cuscon is open
  source, anyone can contribute icons and other changes on Github. Cuscon
  supports most launchers such as Apex, Nova, Smart, Kiss, Lawnchair and others.
  You can request icons that have not yet been added to the application. Most
  calendars can update based on the date if the correct launcher is used.
