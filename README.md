# Homepage

This is a all in one page; it loads all other pages on the webpage on this same webpage.

The pages are loaded with XMLHttpRequests into the webpage. Then it changes with a fancy animation from one to another. It is split up into multiple categories.
Every category is represented with an icon that is located in the folder. The categories are read from the `index.json`.

The animations are meant to look like a circle where every category starts at the middle out. So, the navigation for the pages is located in the middle of the page.
The navbar to switch between the pages in a category is located under every page.
